  <div class="summary">NAEP, short for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, is the federal program that produces recurring national snapshots of student achievement. Voters, journalists, and local residents often ask whether private school students are part of those samples.

This article explains how private schools fit into NAEP sampling, why participation varies across cycles and states, and exactly where readers can check counts and response rates. The guidance is based on NCES program descriptions and cycle technical documentation.

If you need to confirm whether a specific private school took part in a particular cycle, the Data Explorer and the cycle public-use files are the authoritative starting points, with state coordinators able to provide local confirmation.</div>

  <h2>What is NAEP and who does it sample</h2><p>NAEP, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, is the federal program that produces recurring national measures of student achievement in subjects such as reading and mathematics. NCES oversees NAEP design and reporting, and the program is commonly used to show long-term trends and national comparisons for grades included in major cycles. For readers checking local coverage, naep is the label used across NCES documentation and public tools.</p><p>NAEP uses a sampling frame intended to represent students at the national level, and that frame includes both public and private schools for major national assessments such as grade 4 and grade 8 reading and mathematics. This inclusion means private schools are eligible to be selected for participation in national samples.</p><section class="faq-accordion"><input type="checkbox" id="faq-5h9xi5" class="faq-toggle" checked /><label for="faq-5h9xi5" class="faq-summary" role="button" tabindex="0">Do private school students take NAEP?</label><div class="faq-content"><p>Private school students can be selected for NAEP at the national level, but participation is voluntary and coverage varies by cycle and state; check NCES tools and cycle documentation to confirm participation for a specific school or cycle.</p></div></section><p>The program distinguishes between national assessments and state-level NAEP activities. National reports follow a sampling design that can include private schools, while state NAEP releases follow additional rules and coordination with state agencies; those rules can produce different coverage and reporting choices across cycles.</p><p>For a concise program overview and description of scope, NCES maintains an about page and program-level guidance that explains what NAEP measures and the intended uses of national results <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About NAEP: What is the National Assessment of Educational Progress?</a></p><h3>Brief definition</h3><p>In short, NAEP provides recurring national snapshots of student performance in selected subjects and grades, with a sampling approach designed to represent participating student populations.</p><h3>National vs state assessments</h3><p>National assessments aim to produce estimates for the nation and for defined subgroups, while state assessments are structured to support comparisons and reporting at the state level, subject to state-specific rules and participation choices.</p><h2>Does naep include private schools in its samples</h2><p>Yes, private schools are part of the national NAEP sampling frame and are solicited for inclusion in each major cycle; selection does not guarantee participation because school consent is required. NCES documentation explains that the national sample design includes private-sector schools for major assessments and that those schools are invited to participate when selected.

    </figure><p>Participation by private schools is voluntary. NCES conducts recruitment through contractors and works with state coordinators to invite selected schools, but individual schools must agree to take part, and that consent step is a key reason participation can vary across cycles and states.</p><p>That variability matters because private-school response rates are often lower and more variable than public-school response rates, which can affect which estimates are reportable at the national level and whether state reports include private-school results.</p><p>Private-school associations sometimes encourage member schools to participate and offer guidance on NAEP participation, and NCES materials note that recruitment is a managed process involving national contractors and state coordinators.</p><div class="cta-section"><h3 class="cta-headline">Want to stay informed and get involved with Michael Carbonara’s campaign?</h3><div class="cta-intro"><p>Check the NAEP Data Explorer and the cycle technical notes to see whether private schools from your area were in the selected sample and how response rates were handled.</p></div><a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">Join Michael Carbonara’s campaign</a></div><p>Because participation is voluntary and handled locally, readers who need to confirm whether a particular private school received and accepted a NAEP invitation should consult the cycle-specific documentation and the public-use files that list participating schools and counts.</p><p>For program-level confirmation that private schools are included in sampling and how recruitment is managed, NCES technical notes and participation summaries provide the necessary detail and procedural context <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/tdw/technical_notes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP Sampling, Weighting, and Estimation Procedures (Technical Documentation)</a></p><h3>How private schools are solicited</h3><p>When selected, a private school receives recruitment outreach coordinated by NCES contractors and state coordinators; the outreach explains the assessment schedule, student selection rules, and consent requirements. That recruitment process is standardized in technical guidance but is carried out locally. See the NAEP guidance for private schools for cycle-specific materials <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/subject/participating/pdfs/2026-naep-in-your-private-school-naep-devices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP in Your Private School (private-school guidance)</a>.</p><h3>Limits and voluntary nature of participation</h3><p>Because school consent is required, some selected private schools decline or cannot accommodate testing, which leads to incomplete coverage and variable private-school response rates across cycles.</p><h2>How private-school participation actually works during a NAEP cycle</h2><p>Recruitment begins after sample selection. NCES provides selected-school lists to contractors and state coordinators, who contact schools to arrange testing. The initial outreach clarifies logistics, the number of sampled students, and the testing window.</p><p>Selected private schools are asked to provide consent for student participation and to allow test administration on specified dates; the process requires coordination with school administrators and classroom schedules because testing days must be set in advance.</p>

    </div><h3>Testing procedures in private schools</h3><p>Once arrangements are set, test administration follows standard NAEP protocols for proctoring, timing, and student confidentiality; proctors receive the same administration guidance as in public schools.</p><h2>How naep reports private-school results and where they appear</h2><p>NAEP may publish separate national estimates for private-school students when sample sizes, weighting, and reporting standards are satisfied. At the national level, NCES can produce private-sector estimates if the private-school sample is large enough and meets reporting quality thresholds.</p><p>State NAEP releases do not always include private-school estimates. Whether a state report contains private-sector results depends on the cycle, the state's sampling choices, and the private-school response rates achieved within that state.</p><div class="tool-block tool-checklist tool-centered" data-tool-type="checklist">

            </div><p>When NAEP does publish private-school estimates, NCES includes documentation in cycle technical notes that explains sample counts, weighting, and the conditions under which private-school estimates are released.</p><p>Readers trying to find private-school results should use the NAEP Data Explorer and the public-use files for the specific cycle; those resources provide the counts and options to filter by sector so users can see whether private-school results were produced for their national or state queries <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP Data Explorer and Public-Use Files: Accessing Cycle-Specific Private-School Counts and Results</a></p><h3>When NAEP publishes separate private-school estimates</h3><p>NCES follows reporting rules that require minimum sample sizes and quality checks before releasing private-sector estimates. If the criteria are met, separate national estimates for private-school students may appear alongside public-school figures.</p><h3>Differences between national and state reporting</h3><p>The same release that shows national private-school estimates may not include those estimates in a state-level release because state reporting depends on state-specific sample sizes and participation.</p><h2>Sampling, weighting and what lower private-school response rates mean</h2><p>NAEP sampling design places private schools in the national frame, but the design also anticipates nonresponse and applies weighting adjustments to represent the selected population. The technical documentation explains the sampling stages and the ways weights are computed to adjust for selection probabilities and nonresponse. Additional documentation on sampling design is available <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?objectID=162942101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(sample design documentation)</a>.</p><p>Private-school response rates are typically lower and more variable than public-school rates, and NCES documents those rates and the nonresponse adjustments it applies. Lower response can reduce precision and make estimates for private-school subgroups less stable.</p><p>Practically, lower private-school response rates can increase margins of error for private-sector estimates and make comparisons with public-school results less certain. Readers should consult cycle participation tables and weighting notes to see how adjustments were made and what they mean for precision.</p><p>The NAEP technical notes and participation summaries include the nonresponse procedures, the applied weights, and notes about how those adjustments affect the reporting of private-school results <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/tdw/technical_notes.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP Sampling, Weighting, and Estimation Procedures (Technical Documentation)</a></p><h3>Nonresponse adjustments and weighting</h3><p>If a selected private school does not participate, NCES documents the nonresponse and the methods used to adjust weights so that estimates remain representative of the intended population, subject to data quality checks.</p><h3>Impacts on precision and comparability</h3><p>Smaller private-school samples yield wider confidence intervals and less precise estimates. That imprecision can affect subgroup comparisons and trend interpretation, so users should treat weak or small private-sector samples with caution.</p><h2>How to check whether a local private school participated</h2><p>Start with the NAEP Data Explorer. Use the cycle selector and filters to view counts by sector and by geography, and download the public-use files that list participating schools for the cycle of interest. The Data Explorer is the primary NCES tool for cycle-specific private-school counts.</p><p>Next, read the cycle technical documentation, especially the participation tables and weighting notes. Those documents list sample counts, response rates, and any nonresponse adjustments applied in the cycle, which help interpret whether private-school estimates are reliable.</p>

    </div><p>For step-by-step access to school lists and to check local participation, NCES provides public-use files and the Data Explorer that include cycle-specific participation information <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP Data Explorer and Public-Use Files: Accessing Cycle-Specific Private-School Counts and Results</a></p><h3>Using the NAEP Data Explorer and public-use files</h3><p>Filter by cycle, sector, and geography to see whether private schools in your area were included in the sample. Downloading the public-use file lets you search school names and IDs directly.</p><h3>Contacting state coordinators and the school</h3><p>If counts in the public-use files are ambiguous for a local query, the NAEP state coordinator can confirm whether a particular private school received an invitation or participated in the cycle.</p><h2>Common pitfalls and mistakes when reading private-school NAEP numbers</h2><p>A common mistake is overinterpreting results from small or variable private-school samples. Small samples can produce unstable estimates that should not be used for firm comparisons with larger public-school samples.</p><p>Another pitfall is assuming that state NAEP reports automatically include private-school estimates; many state releases omit private-sector figures because sample sizes or response rates did not meet reporting thresholds for that jurisdiction.</p><p>Always check the cycle technical notes and participation tables before drawing conclusions from private-school numbers. Those documents explain sample sizes, nonresponse adjustments, and any reporting limits that affect interpretation.</p><p>For readers making local comparisons, treat private-school estimates as conditional on sufficient sample size and documented weighting procedures rather than as automatically representative of all private-school students in a state.</p><h3>Overinterpreting small samples</h3><p>If a private-school subgroup is based on few participating schools or students, the estimate may have a large margin of error and be unreliable for fine-grained comparisons.</p><h3>Ignoring documentation</h3><p>Skipping the participation tables and weighting notes is risky because those documents explain why an estimate was produced or why it is suppressed for quality reasons.</p><h2>Practical examples: reading NAEP results for a district or state</h2><p>Example 1: national private-school estimate. Suppose a national NAEP release shows a private-school average when the private-school sample met reporting thresholds. In that case, the Data Explorer and cycle technical notes will list the private-school sample counts and explain the weighting used to produce the estimate.</p><p>Example 2: state report without private-school data. If a state release lacks private-school estimates, that absence likely reflects insufficient private-school sample size or low response rates in that state; the cycle documentation will note the reason and indicate whether national private-school estimates remain available.</p><p>In both scenarios, public-use files and cycle documentation are the authoritative sources for exact counts and margin-of-error information that readers should use before interpreting the figures.</p><p>When investigating a local example, always download the cycle public-use file and consult participation tables to confirm whether private-school counts and weights support the comparisons you want to make <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/nde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAEP Data Explorer and Public-Use Files: Accessing Cycle-Specific Private-School Counts and Results</a></p><h3>Example 1: national private-school estimate</h3><p>At the national level, private-school estimates appear when sample and reporting conditions are met; the technical notes state the minimum conditions and show the counts used.</p><h3>Example 2: state report without private-school data</h3><p>For a state lacking private-school estimates, the documentation typically explains that state-level private-sector samples were too small or response rates were insufficient for reliable reporting.</p><h2>Summary and what readers can do next</h2><p>Key takeaways: NAEP can include private schools in its national sampling frame, but private-school participation is voluntary and coverage varies by cycle and state. That variability affects whether private-sector estimates are produced in national or state releases.</p><p>Next steps: use the NAEP Data Explorer, download the cycle public-use files, and read the cycle technical documentation for participation tables and weighting notes to assess sample sizes and margins of error for private-school results. See related coverage on <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/educational-freedom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">educational freedom</a>.</p><p>If you need local confirmation, contact the NAEP state coordinator or the private school to ask whether it was selected and whether it participated in the cycle; local inquiry complements the public-use files and technical notes.

</section><section class="article-ending">If you want to verify participation for a particular private school, start with the NAEP Data Explorer and the cycle technical documentation and follow up with the NAEP state coordinator or the school. These steps let you check sample counts, response rates, and any nonresponse adjustments that could affect local estimates.

The process may require looking at participation tables and public-use files for the cycle you care about; when in doubt, local confirmation resolves questions that summary tables do not answer.</section>
