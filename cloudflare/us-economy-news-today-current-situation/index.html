  <h2>Quick summary: current state of the U.S. economy</h2><h3>One-paragraph snapshot, us economy news today</h3><p>The U.S. economy grew in 2025 but at a more moderate rate than the strong post-pandemic expansion, and consumer spending remained the main engine of demand; according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP expanded in 2025 even as momentum slowed compared with prior years <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/gross-domestic-product-2025-advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEA gross domestic product release</a>.</p><p>Headline and core inflation measures eased over the course of 2025, with the PCE price index moving closer to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent objective, though some service and shelter components stayed elevated; the Fed kept policy rates high into late 2025 to help bring inflation down, and the labour market cooled as payroll gains slowed and the unemployment rate rose modestly, near historically normal levels by year end.</p><p>These developments shape borrowing costs, take-home pay, and local job prospects that affect household budgets and small businesses. Readers following us economy news today should watch incoming agency releases for updates on growth, inflation, and employment.

    </figure><h2>Where growth stood in 2025: GDP and demand</h2><h3>Annual and quarterly GDP patterns</h3><p>Real GDP expanded in 2025 but at a more moderate pace than the immediate post-pandemic years, with quarterly readings showing growth that was positive but steadier than the faster rebounds seen earlier; the BEA’s advance estimates document the overall expansion in output for the year <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/gross-domestic-product-2025-advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEA gross domestic product release</a>.</p><h3>Which sectors and spending components led growth</h3><p>Personal consumption remained the largest contributor to growth in 2025, driven by services more than goods in many months, while retail sales showed mixed results across categories according to monthly trade reports <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/releases/2025/adv.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Census advance retail trade report</a>.</p><section class="faq-accordion"><input type="checkbox" id="faq-snv3q7" class="faq-toggle" checked /><label for="faq-snv3q7" class="faq-summary" role="button" tabindex="0">What is the current situation of the US economy?</label><div class="faq-content"><p>As of early 2026, the U.S. economy expanded in 2025 but at a more moderate pace than the immediate post-pandemic years, inflation eased toward the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent objective while some shelter and service components remained elevated, and the labour market cooled with slower payroll gains and a modest rise in unemployment; near-term forecasts expect modest growth in 2026 with risks tied to wage and shelter inflation and tighter financial conditions.</p></div></section><p>Services spending, including hospitality and professional services, was generally stronger than many goods categories, but higher borrowing costs weighed on interest-sensitive purchases and some durable goods categories; that unevenness across sectors helps explain why aggregate GDP stayed positive even as some businesses experienced slower demand.</p><p>For readers tracking US GDP growth 2025, the takeaway is that aggregate demand was supported primarily by households, but the composition of spending shifted toward service activity and away from some rate-sensitive goods.</p><h2>Inflation trends and the Federal Reserve’s stance</h2><h3>Headline versus core inflation</h3>

      <div class="side-text"><p>Headline and core inflation measures eased through 2025, and the PCE price index moved closer to the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target by late 2025, reflecting a broad cooling in price pressures after the 2022-2023 peaks; the BEA’s personal income and outlays release shows the recent PCE readings and underlying trends <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2026/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEA personal income and outlays release</a>.</p></div>
    </div><h3>Shelter and services components to watch</h3><p>Despite the overall easing, shelter costs and some service categories stayed elevated and are important contributors to measures of inflation that matter for households; those components can keep headline inflation noticeably above core readings in some months.</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee maintained a restrictive monetary policy stance into late 2025, keeping short-term policy rates elevated to further reduce inflationary pressures; the Fed’s statements and press releases describe the rationale for maintaining tighter policy until progress is clear <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve policy statements</a>. See the FOMC projections <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20251210.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h2>The labour market in 2025: cooling from tightness</h2><h3>Payrolls, unemployment, and wage momentum</h3><p>Payroll gains slowed in 2025 and the unemployment rate rose modestly, though joblessness remained near historically normal levels by the end of the year; the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports monthly employment data that illustrate this moderation <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLS employment situation release</a>.</p><p>Wage growth moderated in many measures during 2025, making the path of wages a key uncertainty for both consumer spending and inflation dynamics; slower nominal wages reduce pressure on margins and prices, but stronger wage pockets could sustain demand in some sectors.</p><div class="cta-section"><h3 class="cta-headline">Join the campaign to follow updates and volunteer opportunities</h3><div class="cta-intro"><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the CBO publish monthly and quarterly updates that are the best primary sources for employment trends and policy context.</p></div><a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">Join Michael Carbonara</a></div><p>For workers and policymakers, a near-normal labour market means hiring is still occurring but at a pace that eases overheating risks; that moderation has implications for household incomes and for how quickly policymakers can ease restrictive policy settings.</p><h2>How interest rates and borrowing costs affected households and housing</h2><h3>Mortgage and consumer borrowing</h3><p>The Federal Reserve’s restrictive posture into late 2025 translated into higher short-term interest rates and contributed to elevated mortgage and consumer borrowing costs that affected affordability for some households, as noted in the Fed’s policy communications and CBO analysis <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve policy statements</a>.</p><h3>Sectoral effects: housing, autos, business investment</h3><p>Housing activity and purchases of some durable goods were sensitive to higher rates; higher mortgage rates slowed some buyer activity and affected housing starts and price dynamics in parts of the market, while business investment showed selective strength depending on financing conditions.</p><p>Because effects vary by region and by household balance sheet, some areas with stronger savings or equity tended to weather rate increases better than others; these distributional differences can influence local labour markets and retail activity.</p><h2>What consumers and businesses actually experienced in 2025</h2><h3>Retail and services spending patterns</h3><p>Consumer spending continued to support aggregate demand in 2025 but growth was uneven across categories, with many households spending more on services while purchases of some goods were weaker; the Census Bureau’s advance retail trade figures document the category-by-category variation in sales <a href="https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/releases/2025/adv.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Census advance retail trade report</a>.</p>

    </div><p>Small businesses in services generally reported steadier customer activity than many goods retailers, though higher financing costs made investment decisions more cautious for some firms; these on-the-ground experiences help explain why overall GDP remained positive even where individual firms felt pressure.</p><h3>Practical examples for households</h3><p>For households, this translated into steadier spending on dining out, travel, and personal services, while big-ticket purchases that often require loans, such as some vehicles and home remodels, were more sensitive to higher rates and slowed in several months.</p>

    </div><h2>Risks and the near-term outlook for 2026</h2><h3>Official forecasts and their assumptions</h3><p>Near-term official forecasts project modest growth in 2026, with the Congressional Budget Office offering a medium-term baseline that assumes continued but slower expansion and with upside and downside risks to that path <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBO budget and economic outlook</a>. See CBO's current view <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and the CBO PDF <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2026-01/61831-Economy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><h3>Key uncertainties to watch</h3><p>Key uncertainties for 2026 include the path of wage growth, shelter inflation, and potential external shocks; tighter financial conditions are singled out by forecasters as a primary downside risk that could slow consumer spending and investment.</p><p>To stay informed, readers should follow the monthly employment releases, the quarterly GDP reports, and the BEA’s PCE updates, which together drive revisions to near-term projections.</p><p>Single monthly or quarterly releases are snapshots and can be affected by timing, seasonal adjustments, or one-off events; interpreting them as definitive trends risks overreaction.</p><p>Simple rules help avoid common misreads: focus on core measures, check agency summaries, and compare several indicators before drawing conclusions.</p><div class="tool-block tool-checklist tool-centered" data-tool-type="checklist">

            </div><p>Readers who follow us inflation update or employment headlines should combine headline releases with agency commentary to understand context rather than reacting to a single monthly change.</p><p>Three concise takeaways: growth was positive but moderated in 2025; inflation eased toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal though shelter and some services stayed elevated; and the labour market cooled from its tightest phase while remaining near normal levels. See the <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About</a> page for author information.</p><p>To follow updates, check the BEA for GDP and PCE reports, the BLS for employment releases, the Federal Reserve for policy statements, the CBO for near-term outlooks, and the U.S. Census Bureau for retail trade data; these primary sources publish regular updates that drive the headline narrative <a href="https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/gross-domestic-product-2025-advance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BEA gross domestic product release</a>.</p>

</section><section class="article-ending">For voters and civic readers, following primary releases from the BEA, BLS, Federal Reserve, CBO, and Census Bureau is the clearest way to track changes in growth, prices, and jobs. These agencies publish regular, dated reports that update the picture on a monthly and quarterly cadence.

If you want candidate-specific context for how local concerns may relate to national trends, campaign profiles and public filings can provide verified background on what candidates say they prioritize. According to his campaign site, Michael Carbonara emphasizes themes such as economic opportunity and accountability.</section>
