<div class="summary">Vehicle history reports are a practical first step when researching a used car, but they do not capture every event in a vehicle&#39;s past. This guide explains what these reports typically include, where common gaps appear, and how to layer additional checks to reduce risk.

For many buyers, combining a commercial report with free VIN checks and a pricing valuation is a reliable way to prioritize which listings to inspect. The following sections lay out what to expect in a report, which databases cover what, and a step-by-step workflow to follow before you contact a dealer.</div>

  <h2>What a vehicle history report actually includes</h2><p>A vehicle history report summarizes records collected from a range of public and commercial sources. Providers compile DMV title records, insurance and salvage entries, and commercial data feeds to list items such as title status, ownership history, reported accident history, mileage checks and sometimes service entries. Use the report as a starting point, not a complete log of every event that happened to a car. <a href="https://www.carfax.com/vehicle-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CARFAX vehicle history</a> (see <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/which-vehicle-history-report-is-right-for-you.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds comparison</a>)</p><p>Reports commonly show ownership changes with dates and states, title brands such as salvage or rebuilt when reported to a title database, and mileage entries that can reveal odometer inconsistencies. They can also include dealer service visits and some auction or insurance dispositions when those sources are available. These fields help you spot patterns that merit further inquiry.</p><div class="tool-block tool-calculator tool-centered" data-tool-type="calculator">

            </div><p>Keep in mind providers publish explicit limitations about missing data. Many events are not reported centrally, so a blank area in a report does not guarantee the absence of previous damage or private repairs. Read report limitations carefully and use them to guide follow up questions to the seller rather than to conclude a car is problem free. <a href="https://www.carfax.com/vehicle-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CARFAX vehicle history</a></p><p>Terminology matters. When you see terms such as title status, ownership history, accident history and service history, match them against the mini glossary so you know what each entry refers to and what may be missing. Knowing those labels helps you ask focused questions when a listing or a dealer answer seems incomplete.</p>

<h2>Federal databases vs commercial reports: what NMVTIS covers and what it does not</h2><p>The National Motor Vehicle Title Information System, NMVTIS, is a national repository that is designed to capture title brands and certain disposition events reported by participating entities. It helps centralize some title-related events so they are easier to check across states, but it is not a full replacement for state title records. <a href="https://www.vehiclehistory.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMVTIS overview</a></p><p>NMVTIS coverage depends on which entities report to it and on state processes, so there are documented gaps and reporting delays. A missing brand in NMVTIS does not guarantee a clean past, and conversely a brand may appear later as state offices update records. Treat NMVTIS as one verification layer and use it together with other checks rather than as a single source of truth.</p><section class="faq-accordion"><input type="checkbox" id="faq-i8s60v" class="faq-toggle" checked /><label for="faq-i8s60v" class="faq-summary" role="button" tabindex="0">What does Carfax not tell you?</label><div class="faq-content"><p>Carfax and similar vehicle history reports aggregate many public and commercial sources but can miss private repairs, independent-shop service, some accidents and state-to-state title-brand delays; use multiple VIN checks, pricing comparisons and an independent inspection to reduce risk.</p></div></section><p>One common scenario is a state-to-state transfer where a branded title moves between jurisdictions and the update lags; the brand may not show immediately in a national feed while state records get updated. That timing issue is why a recent salvage repair may not appear in a national snapshot for several weeks or longer. <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/state-salvage-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCSL salvage title overview</a></p><p>Because state rules vary for how salvage and rebuilt titles are defined and recorded, a brand displayed or not displayed on a national report can reflect legal definitions and reporting processes rather than a complete damage history for the vehicle.</p><h2>Why service and repair history is often incomplete</h2><p>Service history records in public reports tend to be incomplete because many independent shops and private owners do not feed their records into centralized databases. Large dealer networks and franchised service centers often appear in datasets, but corner shops and private maintenance do not reliably show up. <a href="https://exchange.aaa.com/automotive/how-to-check-a-used-car-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA guide on checking used car history</a></p>

      <div class="side-text"><p>Common entries you will see include dealer maintenance visits, state inspection records where applicable, and service events reported by national chains. What often does not appear are many independent-shop repairs, private-party service work, and small collision repairs that never reached an insurer or auction. Use the absence of service entries as a prompt to ask the seller for maintenance records rather than as a proof of no work performed.</p></div>
    </div><p>To seek missing maintenance records, request documented receipts and ask for dates, mileage at service, and the shop name. If a seller claims recent major maintenance such as timing belt replacement or transmission work, ask for written proof. Certified dealer service records are more likely to appear in aggregated feeds, but they still should be validated directly with the providing dealer when possible.</p><h2>Title branding, salvage and state differences you should know</h2><p>State rules for salvage and rebuilt titles differ, so the same physical damage can result in different title brands depending on where the vehicle was titled and repaired. A model declared salvage in one state can end up with rebuilt paperwork in another, and states use different thresholds for when to brand a title. <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/state-salvage-title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCSL salvage title overview</a></p><p>Because branding practices vary, a missing brand on a report may not mean the vehicle was never seriously damaged. Transfers across state lines and timing of filings can cause brands to appear later or under different nomenclature. That means a vehicle with a history of significant repair can sometimes look cleaner in a snapshot until state records catch up.</p><p>When you see a salvaged or rebuilt flag, verify the underlying records in the issuing state if possible. Ask for documentation of repairs and certificates of rebuild inspections. Even when a report shows no brand, consider whether title-brand rules in relevant states could hide a past issue and follow up with the seller or state records if you have reason to suspect prior damage. <a href="https://www.vehiclehistory.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMVTIS overview</a></p><h2>Use complementary VIN checks: NICB VINCheck and when to run multiple checks</h2><p>NICB VINCheck is a free service that checks a VIN against theft and certain total-loss records reported to the insurance community and participating partners. It can reveal theft reports and some insurance dispositions, but like other sources it depends on what has been reported to the database. <a href="https://www.nicb.org/vincheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NICB VINCheck</a></p><p>Running multiple VIN checks reduces the chance that you miss a reported event. Combine a commercial vehicle history report with NICB VINCheck and an NMVTIS or state title check to cover different reporting streams. Each source draws on somewhat different inputs, so overlapping checks can reveal inconsistencies you should investigate further.</p>

    </section><p>NICB commonly reports theft records and some total-loss entries that involved insurance reporting. It will not list routine private repairs, independent-shop work, or every collision that escaped insurer involvement. Use NICB as a focused theft and total-loss check, and treat gaps as reasons to request additional documentation from the seller. <a href="https://www.nicb.org/vincheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NICB VINCheck</a></p><p>When to run multiple checks: do the layered VIN searches early in your research before you invest time on a listing. If any check returns a concerning note, support that finding with follow-up requests for documentation and consider an independent inspection before you spend time at a dealer.</p><h2>Compare history with pricing: use Edmunds valuations to spot outliers</h2><p>Use pricing and valuation tools such as Edmunds in parallel with history checks to spot listings with unexpected price differentials. A significant deviation between an asking price and a professional valuation can be an early signal to dig deeper into vehicle condition and records. <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/used-car-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds used car pricing guide</a></p><p>A short how-to: run an <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/appraisal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds appraisal</a> for the exact model, trim, and powertrain, enter the vehicle mileage and condition assumptions, then compare the result to the asking price and to any price analysis label shown on the listing. Differences can highlight either a strong deal or a hidden risk that needs inspection or documentation.</p>
    <div class="side-by-side image-2-right">
      <div class="side-text"><p>Remember valuations vary by regional demand, trim, and powertrain. Use local market context and the vehicle&#39;s exact model year and trim when you compare values, and treat the valuation as an informed estimate rather than as a legal appraisal or final determination of value.</p></div>

    </div><p>Check <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/tmv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds TMV</a> as an additional reference when regional differences matter.</p><h2>A layered verification workflow you can follow</h2><p>Start with a commercial report (for example run a <a href="https://carfaxdeals.com/vinreport" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIN report</a>) to get a quick sense of ownership history and obvious title brands. Next, run NICB VINCheck and check NMVTIS or state title records to cover additional reporting streams. Then run a pricing check using Edmunds to compare the asking price to a market-based estimate. If those checks are acceptable, request dealer or seller service records and schedule a pre-purchase inspection before any purchase decision. <a href="https://www.nicb.org/vincheck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NICB VINCheck</a></p><p>Book an independent pre-purchase inspection with a trusted mechanic or inspection service once the paperwork looks reasonable. An inspection typically catches mechanical or structural issues that reports do not list, and it provides a professional statement you can use to negotiate or walk away if problems are found.</p><div class="cta-section"><h3 class="cta-headline">Run Vehicle History Report</h3><div class="cta-intro"><p>Schedule an independent pre-purchase inspection after you verify VIN checks and pricing to reduce the risk of unreported problems.</p></div><a href="https://carfaxdeals.com/run-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">Run Vehicle History Report</a></div><p>Timing matters. See our how-to guide. Run VIN checks and a pricing valuation early. Request records before you meet the dealer. Only schedule a test drive or inspection once the seller or dealer provides the requested titles and service receipts or gives clear answers you have documented. <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/used-car-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds used car pricing guide</a></p><h2>Decision criteria: when a history report is enough and when to dig deeper</h2><p>Use clear red flags to decide when to pause or walk away. Red flags include a branded title, inconsistent odometer entries, repeated reported incidents, or gaps in maintenance when the vehicle's age and mileage suggest regular service should exist. Any of these usually warrant a full inspection and state-record checks. <a href="https://www.carfax.com/vehicle-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CARFAX vehicle history</a></p><p>Conversely, situations where a report may be sufficient to proceed cautiously include listings with a consistent ownership history, documented dealer service records that match the vehicle mileage, and asking prices that align with a valuation. Even then, a quick independent inspection is a reasonable precaution for most buyers.</p><p>Document seller and dealer answers. Ask for specific dates, shop names and receipts, and note all responses in writing or email. If a seller cannot provide supporting documentation for material claims, treat that absence as a reason to require an inspection or to move on to another listing.</p><h2>Common mistakes, real scenarios and a short checklist to use at the dealer</h2><p>Buyers commonly make three mistakes: relying on a single report as definitive, skipping an independent inspection to save time, and accepting a low price without verifying why it is low. These errors can leave you exposed to unreported repairs or title issues. <a href="https://exchange.aaa.com/automotive/how-to-check-a-used-car-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AAA guide on checking used car history</a></p><p>Two short scenarios show how missing data matters. Scenario one: a private seller reports recent repairs but cannot provide receipts; the report shows no dealer service entries. The right next step is to request receipts and to pause the purchase until an inspection verifies the repair. Scenario two: a listing price is well below market for the trim and mileage; a layered VIN check uncovers a state salvage disposition recorded after a recent title transfer. That combination is a strong signal to walk away.</p>

<p>Printable checklist for a dealer visit and test drive: verify the VIN on the vehicle matches the listing, confirm title status and ownership history, request copies of service receipts and the current title, run a pricing check against Edmunds, and book an independent pre-purchase inspection if any material questions remain. Keep all records and correspondence for negotiation or as evidence if issues arise. <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/used-car-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmunds used car pricing guide</a></p><h2>Conclusion: practical next steps and final takeaways</h2><p>Key next steps: run a commercial vehicle history report, check NICB and NMVTIS or state title records, compare the asking price using edmonds auto values, request service records, and obtain an independent pre-purchase inspection before you commit.
