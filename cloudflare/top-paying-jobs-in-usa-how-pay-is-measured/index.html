It contrasts median occupational wages with total compensation and explains why medical specialties and some executives appear at the top of different lists.

  <h2>What the phrase top paying jobs in usa means</h2><p>The phrase top paying jobs in usa typically refers to occupations that appear at the top of published pay lists, but the exact meaning depends on how pay is measured. Median occupational wage tables report what a typical worker in a job earns, while surveys of total compensation can include bonuses and equity that raise individual totals.</p><p>For a clear, public measure of typical worker pay, analysts commonly point to the Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational wage tables as the primary source for median wages in the United States, because those tables list median pay by occupation and are updated on a regular schedule <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics</a>.</p><p>When people ask about the highest paying jobs, they may mean the occupations with the highest medians, or they may mean the highest single-person pay packages. Those are different questions: occupational medians describe where most workers fall, while named individuals can receive much larger total compensation in special cases.</p><p>Understanding the distinction helps avoid misleading comparisons between a published median and the multimillion-dollar pay packages sometimes reported for individual executives.</p><h2>How official data sources measure pay and produce top paying lists</h2><p>The BLS OEWS compiles median and mean wages across many occupations from employer survey data and publishes national tables that are widely used for comparing jobs by typical pay. The data reflect occupational definitions and reporting periods, which affect rankings across releases <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ocwage.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics</a>. See the BLS <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/highest-paying.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-paying occupations</a> page.</p><p>The BLS approach is useful for occupational medians, but private surveys and specialty reports use different samples and include other pay elements. For example, physician specialty surveys report total annual compensation by specialty and often include bonuses and other pay components that are not part of the BLS median tables <a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-compensation-report-6015129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medscape Physician Compensation Report 2023</a>.</p><div class="cta-section"><h3 class="cta-headline" style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">Join Michael Carbonara's campaign to receive updates and volunteer opportunities</h3><div class="cta-intro"><p>For readers comparing lists, consult primary sources such as the BLS OEWS and the specialty or industry reports that explain what is included in each pay measure.</p></div><a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">Join the Campaign</a></div><p>Industry reports on executive pay and corporate filings capture total compensation for named executives, which can be very large for some individuals. These reports are constructed differently, often aggregating salary, bonus, equity awards and other benefits into a single total-compensation figure.</p><p>Because sources use different definitions, a consistent comparison requires checking whether a list uses medians, means, or total packages and which components are included.</p><h2>Medical and surgical specialties that commonly top pay lists</h2><p>Public occupational wage tables show that medical roles, including physicians and surgeons, are repeatedly among the highest median-paid occupations in the United States, making medicine the dominant field at the top of median-based rankings <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/overview/highest-paying.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highest-paying occupations</a> and rankings such as <a href="https://careers.usnews.com/best-paying-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US News' best-paying jobs</a>.</p><p>Specialty-focused surveys provide greater detail on total physician pay and consistently identify several specialties at the top in terms of average total compensation. Surveys from industry outlets report that orthopedics, cardiology, plastic surgery and anesthesiology are among the physician specialties with the highest average total compensation in recent specialty reports <a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-compensation-report-6015129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medscape Physician Compensation Report 2023</a>.</p><p>Those specialty surveys measure total annual compensation and use samples of practicing physicians, so their published averages can differ from BLS median occupational wages. When comparing, note whether a source reports median or mean compensation and whether it includes bonuses and other pay elements.</p><p>In short, if you look at median occupational pay the top of the list is dominated by medical and surgical occupations, and if you look at specialty surveys of total pay the same medical specialties often appear near the top for individual earnings.</p><h2>CEOs and named executives: when individual pay exceeds occupational medians</h2><p>Analyses of named executive pay show that some chief executives of large public companies receive multimillion-dollar total compensation packages that surpass typical occupational medians, but those high totals are concentrated among a small subgroup rather than reflecting the median for the occupation <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/ceo-pay-trends-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Pay Trends</a>.</p>

    </div><p>Executive pay reports aggregate salary, bonuses, stock awards and other compensation into a total figure for named executives. That total can place an individual among the highest-paid people in the country, while the median for managers or executives as a job category remains far lower in BLS occupational tables.</p><p>For readers comparing lists, it is important to distinguish between a top single-person package and the typical pay level for workers in that occupation, because headline reports about named executives do not change occupational median statistics.</p><h2>High-paying non-medical careers: tech, finance, legal and dental roles</h2>

    <div class="side-by-side special-image-left">

      <div class="side-text"><p>Outside of medicine, industry salary guides and staffing surveys typically place senior roles in technology and finance, such as IT managers and finance managers, among higher-paying occupations, though their medians are often below those for top medical specialties in BLS tables <a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Half Salary Guide 2024</a>, and coverage from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2025/02/11/high-paying-in-demand-jobs-for-2025-revealed-in-new-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>.</p></div>
    </div>
<p>Legal and dental specialties can also appear near the top of some pay lists, depending on how a source defines occupations and whether it captures bonuses or practice ownership income. Comparisons across sectors should check the underlying definitions before concluding which field pays more on average.</p><p>When reviewing non-medical lists, bear in mind that industry guides rely on employer surveys and placement data, which complement public data but may reflect different samples or pay components.</p><h2>Median wages versus total compensation: how to read the numbers</h2><p>Median occupational wages and total compensation are distinct measures. The median tells you what a typical worker in an occupation earns, while total compensation can include bonuses, stock awards and other payments that raise individual totals.</p><p>For example, a physician specialty survey may report an average total pay that is higher than the BLS median for the general occupation, because the survey captures bonuses and specialty practice income not reflected in BLS occupational medians <a href="https://www.doximity.com/reports/physician-compensation-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doximity Physician Compensation Report 2023</a>.</p><section class="faq-accordion"><input type="checkbox" id="faq-txo2on" class="faq-toggle" checked /><label for="faq-txo2on" class="faq-summary" role="button" tabindex="0">What is the highest paying job in the USA?</label><div class="faq-content"><p>Measured by median occupational wages, medical and surgical specialties dominate the top of US pay lists; measured by single-person total compensation, some named CEOs can have larger packages, but those are concentrated among a small group.</p></div></section><p>Practical tips for readers: check whether a number is a median or mean, verify whether bonuses and equity are included, and look at sample size and year. Those details affect how comparable two reported figures are.</p><p>Always prefer primary sources for exact definitions and methodology notes rather than relying on headlines or summary tables, and see our <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About page</a>.</p><h2>Typical qualifications and career pathways for the highest paying jobs</h2><p>Many of the occupations near the top of pay distributions require advanced professional degrees or long periods of specialized training. For example, top physician specialties generally require an MD plus residency and often fellowship training before entering independent practice <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/overview/highest-paying.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highest-paying occupations</a>.</p>

    <div class="side-by-side image-2-right">
      <div class="side-text"><p>Similarly, senior corporate roles and specialized technical management positions frequently require many years of experience and advanced qualifications or certifications. Legal careers that reach high pay levels typically require a JD and time in practice, while dental specialists require dental degrees plus advanced specialty training.</p></div>

    </div>
<p>Because these paths demand time and expense for education and credentialing, prospective entrants should factor training costs, time to credential, and likely pay progression into their decisions, rather than focusing only on headline pay levels.</p><h2>How to decide if a high-paying career is right for you</h2><p>Choosing a career involves weighing median pay, variability, training time and personal fit. Consider criteria such as interest in the work, aptitude, length and cost of training, geographic demand, and lifestyle trade-offs when comparing occupations.</p><div class="tool-block tool-checklist tool-centered" data-tool-type="checklist">

<p>A common error is confusing median and mean. Medians indicate the midpoint of a pay distribution, while means are averages that can be skewed by very high earners. Mixing these measures leads to misleading comparisons.</p><p>Another pitfall is treating a named individual's total compensation as representative of everyone in that occupation. High CEO packages, for instance, reflect a small subset and do not change occupational medians published by public agencies <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/ceo-pay-trends-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Pay Trends</a>.</p><p>Always check the methodology section of any report you use: it will explain sample size, whether bonuses or equity are included, and the period covered.</p><h2>Practical examples and scenarios: comparing three career paths</h2><p>Scenario A, a physician specialty pathway: a medical student who completes MD training, residency and possibly fellowship may reach a specialty with high average total compensation. Specialty surveys report which specialties tend to pay most, though individual outcomes vary and medians differ from specialty averages <a href="https://www.medscape.com/slideshow/2023-compensation-report-6015129" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medscape Physician Compensation Report 2023</a>.</p><p>Scenario B, a corporate executive track: an individual progressing to a named executive role may receive large total compensation packages including equity. These high totals are reported in executive pay analyses but represent a small fraction of all managers <a href="https://www.equilar.com/reports/ceo-pay-trends-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Pay Trends</a>.</p><p>Scenario C, a tech management route: an IT manager or technology director usually follows a path of progressive technical and managerial roles. Industry salary guides show these roles rank among higher-paying non-medical careers, though their medians generally trail top medical specialties in public occupational tables <a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Half Salary Guide 2024</a>.</p><p>These scenarios illustrate how training time, pay variability and the type of pay measure interact to shape career outcomes. Use primary sources to check current figures for any planning exercise.</p><h2>Conclusion and where to check primary sources</h2><p>In summary, when asking what the highest paying job in the USA is, the answer depends on the measure. By median occupational wages, medical and surgical specialties dominate public top-pay lists. When looking at single-person totals, named CEOs and some executives can receive larger packages, though that reflects a small group <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/overview/highest-paying.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Highest-paying occupations</a>.</p><p>For up-to-date verification, consult the primary sources used in this article, including BLS OEWS for median wages and specialty or executive compensation reports for total-pay details, and our <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news page</a>. Checking methodology notes will help you compare figures correctly.</p>
