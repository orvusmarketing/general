  <h2>Overview: ethics and leadership and the 6 Es at a glance</h2>
<p>The 6's of leadership are a concise, practitioner oriented framework that groups core leader responsibilities as Envision, Engage, Enable, Empower, Execute and Evaluate. This framing helps leaders and teams break broad responsibilities into actionable domains and connects the idea of ethics and leadership to everyday practice.</p>
<p>Each of the six domains maps to a familiar leadership task: Envision is setting direction, Engage is building buy in, Enable is removing obstacles, Empower is delegating and developing people, Execute is delivering results, and Evaluate is measuring and adapting. The mnemonic is widely used in development materials and practice guides, and it is intended as a practical checklist rather than a formal academic taxonomy, according to a contemporary guide to leadership and management <a href="https://www.cipd.org/knowledge/strategy/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIPD guide to leadership and management</a>.</p>

    <div class="side-by-side product-image-right">
      <div class="side-text"><a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact Michael Carbonara</a></div>
      <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19k1CPuzH0olHdVBGyuV3n0df-QsS4Jfm" alt="Contact Michael Carbonara" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Practitioners often adapt the labels and order; some sources fold ethical conduct into a separate E or treat it as a cross cutting expectation that should shape all six domains. For readers who want measurable work streams, validated instruments and one page checklists map behaviors to these domains and are commonly recommended in <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional toolkits</a>.</p>
<p>Below we outline each E, link to relevant evidence or <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/strength-and-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practitioner guidance</a> where appropriate, and offer short, practical actions you can use or test in teams. The intent is explanatory: show the logic, note limits, and point to usable tools for assessment and development.</p>

<h2>Definition and context: origins in leadership research and practitioner use</h2>
<p>The idea behind the 6 E's builds on long standing leadership concepts about direction setting and coordinating human effort. Early work that separated leadership from management emphasized how leaders set a direction and create a climate for change; that foundation helps explain why Envision is a core E in nearly every mnemonic and guide, a point traced back to classic leadership writing <a href="https://hbr.org/1990/05/what-leaders-really-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Leaders Really Do</a>.</p>
<p>Modern professional guides and HR bodies translate those high level ideas into practice by describing discrete leader functions such as motivating people, removing obstacles and reviewing performance. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development frames leadership as a set of activities and behaviors used to achieve strategy and develop people, which is the practitioner context in which the 6 E's have gained traction <a href="https://www.cipd.org/knowledge/strategy/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIPD guide to leadership and management</a>.</p>
<p>Labels vary between authors and organisations. Some lists swap Enable and Empower, or add Ethics explicitly as a seventh item, and that variation matters because it shows the mnemonic is a simplification for training and development rather than a standard scientific taxonomy. Where researchers test leadership models directly, they often use validated instruments rather than a single mnemonic, which means the 6 E's are best treated as an organising device for practice and reflection.</p>
<p>Finally, although the 6 E's are convenient for planning and coaching, controlled studies comparing the six item frame to broader leadership models are still limited. That is a gap in the literature to watch for readers who need strict empirical comparisons rather than practical guidance. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40982535/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See a related systematic review</a>.</p>

<h2>Envision: setting direction, meaning and the ethical dimension of vision</h2>
<p>Envision means creating a clear, credible direction that others can understand and support. Practically, envisioning combines a concise statement of purpose with a few specific priorities that explain how success will be recognised and measured. Kotter and other foundational writers emphasise that clear direction improves alignment and adoption of change, and that logic underpins why Envision sits at the start of many development frameworks <a href="https://hbr.org/1990/05/what-leaders-really-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Leaders Really Do</a>.</p>
<p>Good vision statements are concrete enough to guide choices and loose enough to allow adaptation. A short technique is to draft a one sentence purpose, followed by three strategic priorities and two short indicators that show what progress looks like in six months. That structure helps translate a broad goal into actions without over specifying operational detail.</p>
<section class="faq-accordion"><input type="checkbox" id="faq-0bpa51" class="faq-toggle" checked /><label for="faq-0bpa51" class="faq-summary" role="button" tabindex="0">What are the 6 E&#39;s of leadership and why do they matter?</label><div class="faq-content"><p>The 6 E&#39;s are Envision, Engage, Enable, Empower, Execute and Evaluate; they provide a practical framework for leaders to set direction, build commitment, remove obstacles, develop people, deliver results and learn from outcomes, with ethical conduct shaping decisions across all domains.</p></div></section>
<p>Ethical considerations belong in vision work. When leaders craft a direction they should consider fairness, inclusion and truthfulness in how the vision is framed and communicated. Treating ethics as an explicit part of the envision step reduces the risk that a persuasive direction omits important stakeholder interests or misrepresents likely outcomes.</p>
<p>Practical prompts for ethical visioning include asking who benefits from the stated priorities, which groups might be disadvantaged, and whether the language used about trade offs is transparent. These small checks make the vision more durable and more likely to gain legitimate buy in across diverse stakeholders.</p>

<h2>Engage: motivating people, building buy in and practising ethical influence</h2>
<p>Engage covers the techniques leaders use to build understanding and commitment. Common tactics include storytelling that connects tasks to purpose, two way listening, stakeholder mapping to identify who needs to be involved, and feedback loops that show how input affects decisions. These actions are central to converting a stated vision into collective effort.</p>
<p>Evidence from HR and consulting literature shows that active engagement practices - listening, involving people in problem solving and maintaining clear feedback channels - are linked to better team performance and resilience, as reflected in recent practitioner reviews <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/how-managers-can-support-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How managers can support their teams</a> and research summaries <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3387/15/3/112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on ethical leadership</a>.</p>
<p>Ethics and engagement intersect when influence becomes coercive or opaque. Ethical influence means offering reasons and choices rather than manipulation, making the process transparent, and documenting decisions so stakeholders can see how their input was used. These safeguards reduce the risk of eroding trust when leaders need to persuade others to change course.</p>

    <div class="side-by-side special-image-left">
      <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qvdyMJIfBQbbv4LvJ_RSn9bLUlw1HBa0=s1200" alt="Michael Carbonara - Image 1" /></a>
      <div class="side-text"><p>For practical use, leaders can map stakeholders with a simple grid showing level of interest and influence, then plan engagement actions-inform, consult, involve or collaborate-matched to each group. The result is a focused plan that avoids wasting effort on low priority outreach and ensures high priority stakeholders are heard.</p></div>
    </div>

<h2>Enable and Empower: removing barriers, delegating and developing capability</h2>
<p>Enablement and empowerment are complementary but distinct tasks. Enablement is about removing organisational obstacles such as unclear processes, lack of tools, or restrictive policies that prevent teams from doing their work. Empowerment is about giving people authority, supporting capability building and trusting them with decisions. Both elements are needed for sustained performance.</p>
<p>Consulting and HR guidance consistently link enabling work and empowerment with higher team performance and engagement. Practical steps include clarifying roles, streamlining decision paths, and offering targeted training or coaching to build skills, which recent practitioner literature highlights as effective for managers who want to support teams <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/how-managers-can-support-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How managers can support their teams</a>.</p>
<p>Concrete enabling interventions might include a simple RACI update to reduce approval steps, a shared dashboard to remove information bottlenecks, or a fast track for routine procurement decisions that otherwise slow teams down. These changes reduce friction so people can act on the vision without waiting for permission at every turn.</p>
<div class="cta-section"><h3 class="cta-headline" style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">Stay informed and get involved</h3><div class="cta-intro"><p>Consider a short, one page plan that lists three immediate obstacles the team faces, one delegated decision authority change, and one training action to close a capability gap. Review the plan weekly and adjust based on feedback.</p></div><a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="cta-button">Join the Campaign</a></div>
<p>Delegation and empowerment succeed when leaders match authority to capability and provide coaching rather than control. Practical delegation steps are: set clear outcomes, agree constraints, confirm resources and follow up with supportive coaching. That pattern shifts responsibility while keeping accountability visible and reduces micromanagement.</p>
<p>When empowerment is misapplied it can look like abdication or uneven authority. To avoid that, define decision zones and escalation pathways. Use short check ins to monitor how delegated authorities are exercised and offer corrective coaching when outcomes deviate from agreed standards.</p>

<h2>Execute and Evaluate: delivering results, measurement and iterative improvement</h2>

    <div class="side-by-side image-2-right">
      <div class="side-text"><p>Execute focuses on delivery mechanisms: milestones, owners, timelines and accountability practices that turn plans into completed work. Leaders who emphasise execution set clear expectations, match resources to priorities and maintain a regular review cadence so progress stays visible and predictable.</p></div>
      <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XbCCPwbnYQdvuZkGx-nHBXR4KLJ7-ClF=s1200" alt="Michael Carbonara - Image 2" /></a>
    </div>
<p>Execute focuses on delivery mechanisms: milestones, owners, timelines and accountability practices that turn plans into completed work. Leaders who emphasise execution set clear expectations, match resources to priorities and maintain a regular review cadence so progress stays visible and predictable.</p>
<p>Evaluate complements execution by introducing measurement, feedback and iterative improvement. Evaluation can be lightweight: a weekly review that asks what worked, what did not and what to change next. Validated inventories and practitioner toolkits help formalise evaluation by providing behaviourally anchored metrics leaders can use to assess performance across the six domains <a href="https://www.leadershipchallenge.com/LeadershipPracticesInventory.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership Practices Inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Putting the two together creates a plan, act, review, adapt rhythm. For example, set monthly milestones for a quarter, run short retrospectives at each milestone, and adapt the plan based on real evidence. This cadence keeps delivery on track while making room for learning and ethical course corrections when unintended impacts appear.</p>
<p>Measurement choices matter. Use both leading indicators, such as number of decisions resolved or training completions, and lagging indicators like customer satisfaction or team retention. Where possible, select simple metrics that are timely, attributable and connected to the original vision so evaluation informs sensible changes rather than producing noise.</p>

<h2>Tools and quick checklists: validated assessments and one-page self reviews</h2>
<p>Validated instruments such as the Leadership Practices Inventory provide structured ways to measure behaviour across core leadership domains and can be adapted to map onto the 6 E's. These tools are commonly used in leadership development programmes to create baseline assessments and to track change over time <a href="https://www.leadershipchallenge.com/LeadershipPracticesInventory.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership Practices Inventory</a>. Additional research and discussion on ethical leadership can be found in academic reviews <a href="https://www.emerald.com/ebhrm/article/doi/10.1108/EBHRM-01-2025-0041/1307659/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>One page checklists are practical for day to day use. A useful structure is to list the six domains across the top, then under each domain include three observable behaviours you can rate weekly. Keep the checklist short so it is used consistently and pair it with a brief coaching conversation to turn scores into development actions.</p>

<p>Online toolkits and guides offer template questions and sample indicators that teams can adapt. MindTools and similar professional resources publish quick assessments and practical how to pages that show how one page checklists are constructed and used responsibly <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_50.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quick self assessment and leadership development tools</a>.</p>
<p>When using tools, be explicit about what they measure and what they do not. Attribution is important: if you adapt a validated questionnaire, cite the original instrument and avoid overstating the precision of small self reported samples. Calibration with peers and follow up conversations improve the utility of any checklist.</p>

<h2>Common mistakes, short scenarios and closing takeaway on ethics and leadership</h2>
<p>Common errors in applying the 6 E's include skipping evaluation, confusing enablement with micromanagement, and treating ethics as an add on rather than a cross cutting expectation. These mistakes reduce the framework to a set of well meaning tasks rather than an integrated practice that improves trust and performance.</p>
<p>Scenario one, successful: a team leader sets a short vision, involves key stakeholders in planning, removes approval bottlenecks, delegates decision authority with coaching, tracks milestones and runs quick reviews. The result is faster delivery and clearer accountability because each E reinforced the others and ethical checks kept trade offs visible.</p>
<p>Scenario two, unsuccessful: a leader sets an inspiring vision but centralises decisions, avoids stakeholder input and neglects measurement. Work stalls, morale declines and the initial vision becomes seen as empty rhetoric. This illustrates how execution without engagement and evaluation can erode trust.</p>
<p>Final takeaway: applying the 6 E's with an explicit ethic of fairness and transparency strengthens leadership practice. Ethical leadership is not only a moral stance; evidence links leader ethics to employee trust and reduced misconduct, which supports sustained team outcomes. For readers, start with a <a href="https://michaelcarbonara.com/survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short assessment</a>, pick one enabling change and one empowerment action, and schedule a review to see if the changes improve alignment and trust.</p>
